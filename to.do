(Write a basic system for indexing data (learner) by compressing data dumpers)
(write a test to see if we can intercept function calls and results...)
(FQ function name (i.e. Corpus::Reader::readitem), followed by (indexed) input structure, and output structure
 (note that this is very close to the basic structure for sayer)
)

(see if there is already something for memoizing results)
