# enumerate things about a particular item

# come up with a source of data structures: files

# make observations, just spew a list of random observations about something

my $observations = {};

# let's come up with some tests

# we can work in our thing about learning operators, etc, here

# so let observations be things that are true of a particular data structure

# consult with Perl's internals to obtain names for various things, etc.

# don't just build a corpus, but iterate over all items, extracting the possible relations!

# write a program that 'use's all the perl modules on the system.
